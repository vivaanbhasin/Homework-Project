       <h1>Donuts: And why i like them</h1>
       <br>
       <p>A donut is a type of pastry which is deep fried and has a hole in between it. Donuts are mainly recognized because of the unique hole in the middle which other pastries do not have. It is commonly made with flour,sugar,milk and eggs. After it is deep fried then a sweet glaze is applied on the donut. Different glazes are applied to make different flavours of donut. My favourtie donut would be a classic chocolate or hazelnut chocolate donut. Donuts are American, which may come as a suprise to some people. This is why i like donuts.</p>
